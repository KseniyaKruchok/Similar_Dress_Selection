    "# Recommending Similar Dresses - Milestone Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when searching online for a new dress to buy, I don’t have a solid idea of what exactly I am looking for. I might find one dress, that is almost what I want, but not totally. It would be great to be able to see similar items and have a wider choice of something related. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem can benefit both: large retail companies with many different dresses for sale (like Macy’s, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom etc.) to implement or improve this useful tool into their websites and mobile applications, and end users that can spend less time browsing and more time buying.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem I will need a lot of dress images labeled with multiple attributes. I intend to build a convolutional neural network and train it to predict labels. And then further to use predicted labels to identify similar items. In the search for the data my choice stopped at Deep Fashion dataset, carefully crafted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The dataset can be found here: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html\n",
    "\n",
    "These dataset contains over 200,000 images of different clothing categories. Images are presented in two quality types: low resolution for less memory consumption and high resolution for better use in neural networks. There are 1000 attributes that are spread among all categories. The data is organized in several .txt files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. list_category_cloth contains the list of clothing categories labled with unique number\n",
    "2. list_category_img is a list of image urls with a clothing category number to which the item belongs\n",
    "3. list_attr_cloth contains all attributes names numbered according to a category attribute belongs to (like upper body etc.)\n",
    "4. list_attr_img is the same url list with vectors of -1, 0 and 1 corresponding to absence or presence of each attribute (0 means uncertainty)\n",
    "5. list_bbox contains box coordinates for each image that builds around the object\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining first two above datasets I have obtained the urls for only images representing dresses. By merging this new dataframe with the fourth one containing attributes information for each image and assigning column names to be attribute names from the third one, I constructed a dataframe that shows presence of all attributes for dress images. I assumed that uncertainly is rather a negative uncertainty (a different approach of viewing uncertainty as a presence of attribute can be also considered) and I have changed -1 into 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below histogram shows the number of attributes per dress.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](inserts/attributes_per_dress.png)  \n",
